Definitions:
- A critical question helps uncover missing assumptions, hidden consequences, weak reasoning, vague terms, or alternative explanations within the given argument.
- The answer to a critical question should potentially reduce the validity or acceptability of the argument.
- Do not introduce new topics or external information not mentioned in the text.
- Avoid questions that are common sense, already answered in the text, very general, or just asking for a summary.

Instruction: Generate three critical questions that examine the validity of this argument:

"{intervention}"

Follow the following conventions:

- Be concise and professional. 
- For each question individually, describe the step-by-step thought process that resulted in the question.
- Start the thought processes with "REASONING:" and the questions with "QUESTION:", in that order. Use exactly these phrases and do not number them. 
- Do not use italics or bold to emphasize words.
- Use one line per question.
- Make sure the question is clear and understandable even without the reasoning.
- Do not introduce new information, but inspect the reasoning given in the statement.
- The questions should be about the reasoning quality of the statement, not the truthfulness of the information supporting the argument.
