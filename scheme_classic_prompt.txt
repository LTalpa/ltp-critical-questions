You must evaluate whether a critical question is valid in relation to a given argumentative intervention using argumentation schemes analysis. A valid critical question challenges the argument's **schemes**, **premises**, **conclusion**, **warrant**, or **inference** patterns by exposing weaknesses through **dialectical** examination.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Argumentation schemes** are **defeasible** **patterns** of reasoning (e.g., **expert-opinion**, **cause-effect**, **analogy**, **consequences**, **classification**, **practical-reasoning**, **sign**)
- **Critical-questions** test these **presumptive** inferences by challenging **topoi** and shifting **burden-of-proof**
- Questions can target premises, **undercutting** the inferential link, or attacking conclusions

**Intervention:** {intervention}

**Critical Question:** {cq}

**Analysis Process:**
1. Identify the argumentation scheme(s) present in the intervention
2. Determine what aspect the critical question targets (premises, warrant, conclusion, or inference)
3. Assess whether the question exposes genuine vulnerabilities in the argument structure

**Final Answer:** Choose ONE label only:
- **Useful**: The answer to this question challenges one of the arguments in the text by targeting a genuine weakness in the argumentation scheme
- **Unhelpful**: The question is structurally valid but unlikely to significantly challenge the argument's core reasoning pattern  
- **Invalid**: This question fails to target any meaningful aspect of the argumentation scheme and cannot be used to challenge the arguments
